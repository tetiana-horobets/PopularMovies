## PopularMovies
#### Popular Movies is the project which I made from scratch for Android Developer Nanodegree program. The purpose of this project was to build the app, to help users discover popular and highly rated movies on the web. It displays a scrolling grid of movie trailers, launches a details screen whenever a particular movie is selected, allows users to save favorites, play trailers, and read user reviews. This app utilizes core Android user interface components and fetches movie information using themoviedb.org web API.
